away from your unlocked terminal.
You find yourself in a dank cave, with green slime seeping out of every
crevice. As you begin to regain your senses, you hear a shrill whine off in
the distance. You reach for your sudo, but it seems to be gone. You find
a nearby rock, and grip it tightly with one hand as you head off in the
direction of the ominous noise...
